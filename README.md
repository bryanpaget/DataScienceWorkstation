# GNU/Linux Data Science OS Kit

This is a sample data science workstation based on Ubuntu 20.04.

Ubuntu was chosen as the operating system because it is popular with data scientists and Ubuntu is a well known brand which has the reputation for being easy to use and reliable. With long release cycles Ubuntu offers a stable platform to do your work which you won't be forced to upgrade for 5 years and even then upgrades are extremely simple on Linux, in some cases you can simply wipe your disk and install a fresh system and automate the reinstallation of all your apps through shell scripts.

This is my take on what a data scientist needs to to their work and produce the best results.

This has been tested on a Dell Precision 7520 and a Dell Precision 7920.
